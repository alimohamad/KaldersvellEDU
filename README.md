# KaldersvellEDU

(Ali from the future here - I never wrote a README for this when I made the repo so I thought I'd make one now and archive it lol.

This website is the "demo" site for KaldersvellEDU, the first hack I placed Top 5 at a hackathon for. The project was a PHP server running on a Raspberry Pi that hosted an Ace by Cloud9 text editor that did syntax highlighting for Python. 

The script ran on an accessible port, meaning you could open the page from another machine - it sent the Python code to the Pi through a POST request, allowing you to run the Python script you wrote without having to manually SSH into the Pi. Our demo was us making an LED pulse from my teammate Noah's computer.

I worked on most of the UI elements of the project, and this project made me a lot more interested in web development in general.)
